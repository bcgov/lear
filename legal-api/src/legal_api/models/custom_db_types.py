class PostgreSQLXML(UserDefinedType):
    """
    A custom SQLAlchemy type to handle PostgreSQL's XML data type.

    This class allows SQLAlchemy to store and retrieve XML data in PostgreSQL databases.
    It provides methods to bind and process data when inserting into or querying from the database.

    Example usage:
        class MyModel(Base):
            __tablename__ = 'my_model'
            id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
            payload = Column(PostgreSQLXML(), nullable=False)
    """

    def get_col_spec(self):
        """
        Return the column type specification.

        This method returns the string 'XML' to indicate that the column should store XML data.
        """
        return 'XML'

    def bind_processor(self, dialect):
        """
        Return a processor for binding values to the database.

        Args:
            dialect: The database dialect being used.
        Returns:
            A function that processes the value to be stored in the database. In this case, the function
            returns the value unchanged, as no special processing is needed.
        """
        def process(value):

        Args:
            dialect: The database dialect being used.
            coltype: The column type.
