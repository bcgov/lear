"""Flask Plugin to manage the use of the Registry JSONSchemas.

Schemas are loaded, globally cached and can be optionally verified on initial load.
Validations are made against these pre-loaded schemas.

Best practice is to validate the schemas using the pytest framework and only deploying once fully compliant.
