-- Description:
-- This script identifies the last historical filing before the 'lear_tombstone' filing for each business and sets 
-- backfill_cutoff_filing_id to that filing ID for businesses that have been ALREADY migrated.
--
-- Context:
-- During tombstone migration, historical filings from COLIN are migrated first, followed by a 'lear_tombstone' 
-- marker filing. The backfill_cutoff_filing_id should point to the last historical filing before this marker
-- to establish a clear boundary between migrated historical data and future LEAR-native filings.
--
-- What is exactly changing: Businesses that have been migrated (have a 'lear_tombstone' filing) but backfill_cutoff_filing_id is null

-- Update backfill_cutoff_filing_id for migrated businesses from null to the last historical filing <-- Main Query
