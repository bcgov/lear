              It is a company's legal responsibility to keep company information current with the Corporate Registry,
              such as updating director and address information. Ensure that this information is updated before
              filing your annual report.
            </p>

              In addition to filing the annual report with the Business Registry, there is a legal requirement for
              benefit companies to publish an annual Benefit Report. See section 51.994 of the Business Corporations
              Act for more information on the annual Benefit Report. We recommend seeking legal assistance when
              creating your annual Benefit Report.

              Section 51 of the Business Corporations Act requires every BC company to file an annual report
              within two months of its anniversary date of recognition. The registrar may dissolve a company if the
              company fails to file for two consecutive years. For more information, please contact BC Registries.
