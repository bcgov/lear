Your name request {{ nr_number }} for the approved name **{{ legal_name }}** is due to expire on {{ expiration_date }}.

If your name request expires, you will need to pay for another name request, and wait for it to be reviewed.

As well, if your name request expires, the approved name becomes available to the public.

We recommend that you use your name request before it expires, or go to [www.bcregistry.ca/namerequest](www.bcregistry.ca/namerequest) and renew your name request.

To renew your name request:

* Go to [www.bcregistry.ca/namerequest](www.bcregistry.ca/namerequest)
* Go to the "Manage My Name Request" tab
* Enter the NR number ({{ nr_number }}), and applicant's phone number or email address
* Click the "Retrieve Name Request" button
* Click "Renew Name Request ($30)"
* Pay

Name requests are renewed for an additional 56 days from the original expiry date, with the exception of restoration or reinstatements, which are renewed for 1 year and 56 days.
