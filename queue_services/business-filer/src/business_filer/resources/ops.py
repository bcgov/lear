Module Name: Blueprint Ops
Description: This module contains routes that are used to check the health and readiness of the API.
The module includes two routes, "/healthz", and "/readyz", which respond with status messages indicating the health and
readiness of the API respectively.
Health is determined by the ability to execute a simple SELECT 1 query on the connected database.
