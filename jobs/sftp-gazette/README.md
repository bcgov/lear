# Notebook Report

Generate notebook report

## Development Environment

Follow the instructions of the [Development Readme](https://github.com/bcgov/entity/blob/master/docs/development.md)
to setup your local development environment.

## Development Setup

1. Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/bcgov/entity/blob/master/docs/setup-forking-workflow.md) to checkout the project from GitHub.
2. Open the notebook-report directory in VS Code to treat it as a project (or WSL projec). To prevent version clashes, set up a virtual environment to install the Python packages used by this project.
3. Run `make setup` to set up the virtual environment and install libraries.
4. The following command will generate a pair of private key and public key. The private key will be kept on the calling side and the public key will be kept on the called side (sftp host side) - from command line
   > ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C 'BCRegistries'
5. The following command will print a public key which will be used on the calling side (i.e openshift) - from command line
   > ssh-keyscan server.gov.bc.ca

   this will print the public key. Store the string after ssh-rsa to the SFTP_HOST_KEY configurations on openshift.

## Running Notebook Report

1. Run `. venv/bin/activate` to change to `venv` environment.
2. Run notebook with `python sftpgazette.py`

## Added permission to run.sh file if it is needed

git add --chmod=+x path/to/file

## Running Unit Tests

1. Run `python -m pytest` or `pytest` command.

### Build API - can be done in VS Code

1. Login to openshift

   ```sh
   oc login xxxxxxx
   ```

2. switch to tools namespace

   ```sh
   oc project cc892f-tools
   ```

3. Create build image with a tag 'latest'.

   ```sh   
   oc process -f openshift/templates/bc.yaml \
   -p GIT_REPO_URL=https://github.com/bcgov/lear.git \
   -p GIT_REF=main \
   -o yaml \
   | oc apply -f - -n cc892f-tools  
   ```
4. Checking log for building process at Console => Administrator => Builds => Builds => click image 'sftp-gazette' => logs

5. Tag image to dev: 'oc tag sftp-gazette:latest sftp-gazette:dev'


### Create cron

1. Login to openshift

   ```sh
   oc login xxxxxxx
   ```

2. switch to dev namespace

   ```sh
   oc project cc892f-dev
   ```

3. Create cron

   ```sh
   oc process -f openshift/templates/cronjob.yaml \
  -p TAG=dev \
  -p SCHEDULE="30 1 * * TUE" \
  -o yaml \
  | oc apply -f - -n cc892f-dev
  ```

4. Create a job to run and test it: 'oc create job sftp-gazette-dev-1 --from=cronjob/sftp-gazette-dev -n cc892f-dev'
